> The instructions below were written for Claude Code. In this harness, read their tool references as follows:
>
> - **Task tool** with `subagent_type: "<plugin>:<agent>"` → call `task` with `agent: "<plugin>:<agent>"` (the id is unchanged) and the prompt as the item's `task`. `run_in_background` has no equivalent: `task` runs asynchronously and results are delivered when agents finish. "Dispatch in parallel" means one `task` call with several items.
> - **TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TaskList** → the `todo` tool: `init` with the listed subjects, `start` / `done` by subject text, `view` to list. `activeForm` has no equivalent. A subagent has no `todo` tool: when running as one, skip these progress-tracking steps and do the work they announce.
> - **AskUserQuestion** → the `ask` tool. `multiSelect: true` → `multi: true`.
> - **Skill tool**, `Skill(skill: "<name>")`, or a skill cited as `<plugin>:<name>` → `read skill://<plugin>:<name>`. Every skill is addressed with its plugin prefix; a skill named without one belongs to this plugin, so read `skill://{plugin}:<name>`.
> - In an agent's instructions, `ARGUMENTS` (prefixed with a dollar sign) stands for the task text you were given.
> - **WebSearch** → `web_search`. **WebFetch** → `read` on the URL.
> - A subagent has no `ask` tool: where the instructions say to ask the user, choose the most likely option and state the choice and its reason in your report.
> - **allowed-tools** and `Bash(<cmd>:*)` grants are Claude Code permission pre-approvals. They grant and restrict nothing here.
> - In the text below, a backticked command right after `!` (for example !`git status`) is Claude Code inline context: Claude Code runs it and puts its output there before the model reads the text. Here nothing ran: run each such command in the text below with `bash` first and use its output in its place.
